## Emotional Mouse Project

This is a computer mouse that makes an cute/angry noise if you're too rought with it. It gets stressed out. Starts shaking the cursor.
Then you have to pick it up and calm it down. 

Parts needed:

A computer mouse to butcher
A small sound sensor
A Raspi Pico
A speakersound board

Project notes for me:

The mouse coloured cables are

Brown - G   GND
Blue -  V   +5V
White - C   Data
Green - D   Data
