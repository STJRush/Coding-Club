sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade



sudo pip3 install opencv-python
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev
sudo apt-get install libjasper-dev
sudo apt-get install libqtgui4
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
sudo apt-get install libqt4-test


This almost works but there's one more error on 
the current pip version of opencv:


ERROR: opencv: undefined symbol: __atomic_fetch_add_8



Follow the fix here:

https://github.com/piwheels/packages/issues/59

Which is basically, you have to open the file in the terminal.
And do it in a weird way.

Instead of going like normal, using cd and ls to naviagate to 
your file and opening it with

sudo python3 yourFileNameWhatever.py

you need to add in a 

LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libatomic.so.1 python3

so it would be

sudo LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libatomic.so.1 python3 yourFileNameWhatever.py
