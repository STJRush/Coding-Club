## How to Preview a Markdown File in VSCode

To preview a markdown file in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. Open the markdown file you want to preview.
2. Click on the `View` menu at the top of the window.
3. Select `Command Palette` or press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) to open the command palette.
4. Type `Markdown: Open Preview` and select it from the list.

Alternatively, you can use the shortcut `Ctrl+K V` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+K V` (Mac) to open the markdown preview directly.

You can also open a side-by-side preview by selecting `Markdown: Open Preview to the Side` from the command palette or using the shortcut `Ctrl+K V` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+K V` (Mac).

This will allow you to see a live preview of your markdown file as you edit it.
